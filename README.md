Julia multi-scale algorithms for entropic optimal transport, following https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06519.

This doesn't aim to be a comprehensive Julia fork of Bernhard Schmitzer's library https://github.com/bernhard-schmitzer/MultiScaleOT, but just allow some of its functionality for testing and providing methods to the domain decomposition library https://github.com/ismedina/DomDecOT.jl

For documentation see https://ismedina.github.io/MultiScaleOT.jl/dev/.
