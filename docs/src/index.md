## MultiScaleOT.jl

`MultiScaleOT.jl` is a Julia library for solving optimal transport problems by means of a hierarchical Sinkhorn, as proposed in [Schmitzer, Stabilized Sparse Scaling Algorithms for Entropy Regularized Transport Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06519). It also provides routines for handling measures organized in a hierarchical manner and for refining them. It is the backbone of [`DomDecOT.jl`](https://github.com/ismedina/DomDecOT.jl/), another Julia library that implements the domain decomposition algorithm for entropic optimal transport. The focus of this library is flexibility and performance.
